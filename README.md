100% generative patch driven by teletype.  
\#1 randomly select a note in C-minor, 20% of the time a note close to the
the last note, 6% of the time a random note, the note is stored in
variable A.  
\#2 might overwrite this note with a knob movement.  
\#3 randomly selects between three sets of chords that go with each
note, and sends a random note from the chord to a three voice unit on
the ER-301.  
  
Controls:  
TI.PRM 1: probability of the fm-perc to play.  
TI.PRM 2: probability that a chord note will be played.  
TI.PRM 3: probability that a new note is randomly selected  
TI.PRM 4: overwrites the current note if knob is moved  
PRM: jitter to M, CW: no jitter, CCW: max jitter  
Joystick X: length of fm-perc (ER-301)  
Joystick Y: brightness of chord notes (ER-301)

# mom-series  
My mom has trouble sleeping at night, so I'm putting together a series of ambient pieces for her to relax to.  
## mom 1
[![mom 1 on instagram](https://github.com/attejensen/teletype/blob/master/pix/mom_1.jpg?raw=true)](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwFW5GxBanv)  
Four parts, selected by knob, each part has it's own pattern (0-3)  
Each patterns contain notes, pattern 0 more basic (mostly octaves and 5ths), ranging to pattern 3, which contains more complex notes.  

Metro script randomizes itself  
Script 1-3 triggers one voice each on the ER-301  
Script 8 stops 
  
## mom 2
[![mom 2 on instagram](https://github.com/attejensen/teletype/blob/master/pix/mom_2.jpg?raw=true)](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwIAOgsB2Om)  
Three chords (C, F, Dm) selected on knob  
F6/F7 -/+ activity (0-100)  
F8 Randomize pattern start and length  

Pattern layout: 
Pattern 0: C-major chord  
Pattern 1: F-major chord  
Pattern 2: D-minor chord   
rows 0-15: notes for soft bleep sound  
rows 16-19: notes for strings  
  
## mom 3

10 partials from the overtone series on the er-301. Teletype radomizes gains and slews of those gain changes
