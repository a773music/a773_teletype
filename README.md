Tracks split over two scenes, selected on knob. For this to work the scenes must be in locations 7 and 8 (or edit the code, change "7" in the last two lines of script 8 in both scenes to the location of the first scene, the second scene must then be next from the first).

# mom-series  
My mom has trouble sleeping at night, so I'm putting together a series of ambient pieces for her to relax to.  
## mom 1
[![mom 1 on instagram](https://github.com/attejensen/teletype/blob/master/pix/mom_1.jpg?raw=true)](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwFW5GxBanv)  
Four parts, selected by knob, each part has it's own pattern (0-3)  
Each patterns contain notes, pattern 0 more basic (mostly octaves and 5ths), ranging to pattern 3, which contains more complex notes.  

Metro script randomizes itself  
Script 1-3 triggers one voice each on the ER-301  
Script 8 stops 
  
## mom 2

Three chords (C, F, Dm) selected on knob  
F6/F7 -/+ activity (0-100)  
F8 Randomize pattern start and length  

Pattern layout: 
Pattern 0: C-major chord  
Pattern 1: F-major chord  
Pattern 2: D-minor chord   
rows 0-15: notes for soft bleep sound  
rows 16-19: notes for strings
